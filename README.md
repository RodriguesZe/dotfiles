# Dotfiles

This is a collection of my custom configurations. 

It's based on my personal preferences and needs and helps me get more productive along the day. Be aware that it might not be a fit for your needs. Use it with caution.

It is always a work in progress, so feel free to suggest any improvements.



## Installation

```markdown
$ git clone git@github.com:RodriguesZe/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ ./fresh-installation.sh
```



## Structure

This section explains the structure and why these folders exist. Some basic stuff may be left out in order to have this explanation as clean and concise as possible.

#### helpers

I like to have some kind of interaction when a script of mine runs. It helps me remember that, in order to be the most useful, needs to be constantly improved. 

To that end, there are some helper functions that help in the development of all the scripts. 

#### terminal

These folders contain scripts that help me with tasks that are not related to a specific tool, but rather to a process or action I do frequently.

#### git

Mostly git flows of steroids.



## Considerations

Since moving from windows, I started using aliases in order to improve my workflow. It got to a point where this was no longer enough.

This dotfiles repo was started after some talks about this subject with [Jerome Faria] but were also inspired - some just outright stolen - from people like [Gabe Berke-Williams] and [Nick Nisi].
